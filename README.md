# Predict-California-Housing-Prices
A regression problem 
 
This is my first notebook, where I've tried to implement what I've learned.
I've run nine different and varied algorithms to compare their performance with different metrics and see how good they are with Boston house data and how they go about making predictions based on their assumptions.
Also, this notebook comes with a brief description of each algorithm and metric and other stuff.


This is part of the exercise from "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit learn and Tensorflow" textbook
