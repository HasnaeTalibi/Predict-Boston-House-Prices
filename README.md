# Predict-California-Housing-Prices
A regression problem 
 
This is my first notebook, where I've tried to implement what I've learned.
I've run nine different and varied algorithms to compare their performance with different metrics in order to pick up the best model that captures the signals of the data and then make predictions 
Also, this notebook comes with a brief description of all the algorithm and metric used and some other stuff.


This is part of the exercise from "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit learn and Tensorflow" textbook
